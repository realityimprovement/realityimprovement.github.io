</footer><!-- /.post-info --><p>I'm want to try and wrap up my America trip quickly. I haven't done much since
I got to London, but I want to start writing about stuff a little closer to now
but still feel an urge to wrap up the previous trip. So I'm going to rip 
through it quickly.</p>
<h2>A Brief overview</h2>
<p>Here is a list of things that happened post Charlotte in the approximate order
that they occured.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>I stopped for lunch in Asheville. And loved the place so much I stayed for
dinner, went to a bar to watch some bluegrass music and met some awesome people.
Overall North Carolina continuously had my best experiences.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I had to stop at this bowling alley and play a game. I mean look at it.

<a href="https://flic.kr/p/oeiYHX"><img alt="P1010337" src="https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2905/14590471065_04a51198a0_c.jpg" /></a>
<a href="https://flic.kr/p/nWP4DC"><img alt="P1010338" src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3866/14403765450_5ee7743ec2_c.jpg" /></a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Nashville on the other hand didn't have as much appeal. Just had a weird vibe
about the place or something I don't know. I went to check in to hostel in the
center of town when I realised I'd left my driver's license back in Charlotte.
Decided to leave the hostel and keep driving. But I kept going west rather than
doubling back, I'd get my license on the return.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I played poker on a river boat in Metropolis. And I met Superman.
<a href="https://flic.kr/p/nWQp7a" title="He didn't say much"><img alt="P1010346" src="https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2928/14404026017_07466f6f76_c.jpg" /></a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Got to St. Louis and realised I left one of my shirts behind in Metropolis.
Kept looking for outdoor stores where I could by a replacement icebreaker shirt.
Ended up driving straight through St. Louis without stopping. Only thing I can
say about the experience is that months later when House of Cards featured 
it in the background of a scene, I recognised it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Got to Kansas city. More degenarate poker playing. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Started driving through Kansas. I'd been warned Kansas was different, it
wouldn't be fun to drive across. I didn't believe it. I've written a more
detailed account of Kansas below.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Abandoned plan to drive to San Francisco and started heading south again.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Played poker at two different Native American Casinos. (I played a lot more 
poker than I realised).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Stopped in Dallas for dinner at a restaurant that was recommended to me by
a vegan at the first Casino in the previous point. It was very good. The next
day was the anniversary of the JFK assasination. Something a traveller might
want to stay in town to experience. I drove east instead.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Finally got to New Orleans. Visited Bourbon street. Seems like a fun place
if you were drunk but wasn't my cup of tea. Stayed one night in a hostel, but
there was no room the next night, stayed in my car.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After a grand total of two days in New Orleans, decided it wasn't for me and
headed north. Amount of live music experienced: minimal.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Spent my birthday alone driving a car.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Made it back to the jewel of America, North Carolina. In Charlotte I got
my licence back and had a great dinner at a Vegetarian restaurant. The next day
I found myself in a college town called Greensboro further noth. Stopping at 
another vegetarian restaurant (I
mainly navigated around the country using the <a href="www.happycow.net">Happy Cow</a>
phone app) I made friends with the wait staff. They were the best. They took me
out to a bar after they finished work. Told me about the Civil Rights museum
in town which I checked out the next day. They were so lovely, I went back and
had lunch there the next day before I had to get back on the road. Have I 
mentioned that North Carolina was my favourite place in America?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>2 days later I returned the car in Washington D.C. and caught and bus back
to New York.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Because I got back a few days early, I was able to kind of experience
Thanksgiving with Nick before he was leaving the country. 
I say kind of because I don't think there was an actual American amongst us.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>And on the last evening my friend Chevy was in town from London. She was
staying at Nick's after I left. So we went out, and went ice skating in front
of the Rockefeller building. Then at about 4am I started making my way to 
the airport to catch my plane to London.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2>Kansas: A study</h2>
<p>"Kansas is different, you'll see"</p>
<p>I want to focus a little on Kansas in more detail because it's kind of a turning
point in the story and an example of where I think I went wrong in some of
my attitude to travel on this trip. A lesson I should re-learn now.</p>
<p>There were some phrases that were repeated again and again as I would cross
America. When I mentioned that my original plan was to hitch across the country
I would get a lot of "Oh no, you're crazy. You can't do that anymore."</p>
<p>I believe there is a lot revealed in the psyche of, if not Americans in general,
at least the ones I met. What is revealed, I'm not entirely sure. There is 
definitly a lot of fear in the
air. I would often think unfounded fear, and then I'd remember how many guns 
were around.</p>
<p>Something else I heard everywhere I went, when I told people where I was going,
"Oh, they're not as nice as us here." This always turned out to be a lie. 
Everyone I met was lovely. I never met these phantom awful people everyone else
was afraid of. Again a statment that reveals something, not so much in what is 
said but in the sheer repetition. Here is good, there not so much. <sup id="fnref:1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>
<p>So seeing the obvious falseness of this commonly held belief, I dismissed the 
warning I kept receiving as I moved further and further west. </p>
<p>"Oh yeah, it's nice driving through here, but Kansas is different."</p>
<p>I figured all this exaggeration about the madness inducing flatness of Kansas
was just that, an exaggeration. How wrong I was.</p>
<p>I saw a lot of rest stops on this trip. And each state has a definite fee to
their rest stops. All had the same basic layout accross the 
country but there is a stil a unique feel to each state. But Kansas is the 
scariest.</p>
<p>Scariest is the wrong feeling. Foreboding.</p>
<p>Kansas is the most Foreboding.</p>
<p>At each rest stop in Kansas is a speaker crackling out the weather report:</p>
<p><em>Fine Weather Today.</em></p>
<p><em>Getting Colder as the week continues.</em></p>
<p><em>There may be snow by the end of the week.</em></p>
<p>Repeat forever.</p>
<p>Honestly at this point I feel like I'm living in some post-apocolyptic film or 
video game.</p>
<p>And I'm a little worried about snow later in the week, I'm not prepared for that
and I know I'm heading up the Colardo mountains. But the weather report says
it will be fine for a few days. So why does this whole situation just give me
the heebee jeebies.</p>
<p>Maybe it is the flatness. There is no corn. It's November so all the corn has
been harvested. So literally the only thing I can see is this weird juxtapositon
of fields of small oil pumps alongside fields of windmill genearators. And 
nothing.</p>
<p>Not nothing. Nothing I can deal with. I've breifly visited the north-west corner
of Australia. Once I was outside of town, you are literally nowhere. There is 
nothing for miles.</p>
<p>See Kansas is different. There's not nothing. There's something else.</p>
<p>Kansas has two main routes. The interstate heading East-West, and the interstate
heading North-South. And they meet roughly in the middle of the state.
I'm driving west. And every 20 or 30 so miles, I would pass a small town, with a
water tower declaring their name. A lot of towns, but still a feeling of nothing.</p>
<p>I stopped and bought a pizza from a Pizza Hut in one of these towns. I think 
that illustrates most clearly what I'm trying to say. You're just not really
in the middle of nowhere if you can stop and buy Pizza Hut. But then I
drove to park to have an a pizza picnic. And again despite being in what 
amounted to small town suburbia, there was that overwheling air of isolation. </p>
<p>I thought as I ate. 
I was only halfway accross the state. I could abandon this mad dash to get
to the West Coast. Why am I in such a hurry. Sure it would be nice to see Andy,
but I didn't have to see him. I would no doubt be back at another time. I could
do San Francisco properly at another time, without an artificial rush.</p>
<p>But the Kansas madness must of been setting in. I was already halfway. I could
make it. </p>
<p>Six Hours, 3 more rest stop nightmare factories and one gas station fill up 
later I crossed the Colarado border. The road was immediately different. There
was a physical line at the border where two different strains of ashphalt 
greeted each other</p>
<p>I pulled into a rest stop and really started to evaluate my situation
again. It was getting late, I'd have to stop for the night soon. People had
warned me there were a few more hours of flat after crossing the border before
the mountains started. More of the same if with a slightly different flavour. 
But then I looked at my map of America again. I had barely reached the halfway 
point of the country. If I was going to cross in 3 days I would have to drive 
without stopping. And then I would have to turn back straight away again to get
back to the East Coast <sup id="fnref:2"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>I wasn't going to make it to San Francisco. It was 
time to go back to plan A and head for New Orleans. </p>
<p>I think the lesson to learn here is that there's no reason to be in a rush to
get nowhere. I'm not saying that seeing San Francisco with Andy wouldn't have
been nice. But if I'd taken that route, that's not the trip I was signing up 
for. I would be signing up for hours and hours of driving with little chance to
stop and smell the metaphorical roses. If you've read the list, you'll see I
didn't really learn this lesson very well. I practically bypassed Dallas in a 
similar non-necessary rush to get to New Orleans. And in my rush to get there
I didn't really give myself the chance to enjoy myself once I got there.</p>
<p>In complete opposition to this, when I removed the rush I enjoyed myself more.
Washington DC and all the Nortch Carolina stops, both outbound and return 
journeys, were the highlights of the trips because I was able to take my time
and enjoy myself, staying longer if I wanted. I think it's important still to
have a need to leave eventually. I feel some of my disappointments with New
York initially were that I had little impetus to go out and have daily 
adventures because I had so much time, but at the same time it wasn't "home" so
something still felt off. I think I'm having a similar experience in London.</p>
<p>After all that though, and as fun as it is to evaluate decicions and experiences
in retrospect and add more significance to them than they probably warrent, 
I think the Kansas experience sticks so much in my mind
as a big deal is a geography fact. You'll remember there is essentially only 
two roads through Kansas. And they meet in the middle. The shortest distance
south was back the way I came. So after a grand total of half an hour in 
Colorado I turned around, and headed straight back into Kansas. An empty pizza
box in the passenger seat mocked me.</p>

<p>In probably a related phenomenon, everyone was shocked that I'd left
