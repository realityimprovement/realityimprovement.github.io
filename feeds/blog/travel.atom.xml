A hug from a friend, before 3 days asleep on a couch, sometimes the floor. 
The room is the loungeroom and residents of the house step around and over me to 
access the kitchen. I do not
notice. Neccesary chores happen in a daze, a bank account opened, a National
Insurance number applied for. A room in a sharehouse is found on Facebook. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My first home is a sharehouse in the west London suburb of Acton; the defacto
location of new Australians in town. I found it on the facebook group Kiwis 
in London, New Zealanders and Australians helping each other out. A cheap if
somewhat rundown 5 bedroom. I'm in the smallest room upstairs, a slightly damp
room mostly occupied by an uncomfortable double bed and temporarily vacated
by an Australian couple returning home for a summer Christmas. A decidedly 
smarter plan than my arrive in a dark and cold December London. A large, often
crashed in loungeroom and a deceptively small and pokey kitchen (the eight
burner stove and 
two separate sinks conspire to rob the space of useable benchspace)
complete the picture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't really like sleeping in their bed, so I start
experimenting with different options. I try the floor for a while before I settle
on a hammock. It hangsbetween the door and a chin up bar bought off ebay, wedged
into the concrete window frame. I never quite got the right balance with my warmth
or comfort, but it was a fun time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A whole bunch of easy excuses led to two months of not working. I could tell 
mysef  that I'd arrived too
late to get a December Christmas Job and I still didn't have my National Insurance
Number.&lt;sup id="fnref:1"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1" rel="footnote"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; But the biggest one was that I would be able to easily set myself
up for freelance work
building and designing websites. Something that I could do from road on my 
expected many journeys.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I spent the months remembering how to program in Python, refreshing  my 
knowledge of HTML and CSS. But at the end of two months, a domain was bought but
no company was 
created, no new apps were built. My website had moved from Wordpress to Pelican
and I had officially contributed to an open source project. But the savings
were beginning to run low. I was Productive but note &lt;em&gt;Profitable&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was no social life at this point. The amount of times I caught up with
friends over these two months can be counted on one hand. I was trying to live
cheaply in an expensive city. I didn't bond strongly with my new housemates. I 
was a shut in, jogging occaisonally and tapping away on my computer. The only 
new person I met was the owner of the new vegetarian restaurant around the 
corner, the food was very cheap. I did spend Christmas with Cecilia and James,
as they stopped by on their European holiday. And spent New Years with my friend
Chevy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The time at Acton is drawing to a close. The rooms real owners are returning.
I've started to venture from my cave. I've discovered the Barclay's Cycle Hire
and am riding it around town. I've discovered Improv. It exists in london. Not
only that I've made my first real London friends, all on my own. On one of my now
more frequent Journeys out of Zone 3 into the city I'm inspired by the cyclists
riding cargo cycles. I could do that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Accepting the realiy that the web stuff wasn't going to get picked up anytime
soon I started looking for an actual job. I was inspired by the cargo cycles 
some googling led me to email a company called Gnewt Cargo. And they wanted to
have a chat with me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The website was a little out of date. They had traded up most of their tricycle
cargo rickshaws for electric vans. But they seemed like nice people and I needed
the job. And then fortune smiled brightly on me. The day of my training trial,
normally a two day affair, one of their drivers quit/was fired. And he was on
a TNT document route. A route currently being done on electric scooter, but 
one that would be suited to one of their Bullit Bikes. Pure pedal power. 
Training fast-forwarded due to need and the fact
that I wasn't an idiot and had done similar work in Australia and I was starting
work the next day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A winter with no snow meant that February and March were actually the wettest
there have been in recent memory. To the North East of London, the country was
flooding. And I was out riding in it everyday and having a ball. Quickly learning
my patch of the city, the EC2 postcode, I was soon covering EC3 or EC4 on the
quiet days when drivers were sick or on holiday. I was finally &lt;em&gt;living&lt;/em&gt; in 
London. My favourite moment was after a very wet moment. The sun peeked out 
behind a cloud, seeing if it was time for spring yet, just as I was riding past
the Tower of london. A gorgeous sight and uniquely London, I could not have had
this experience back in Sydney. There's no Tower of London there. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not all things can last though. As the months ended the document route added
parcels and collections. Not wanting to be in a van full time, I trained up 
a replacement and was moved to a Hermes route. Delivering
online shopping parcels, running back and fourth from the depot five or six times
a day to my new, much smaller delivery zone of the few blocks immediately 
surrounding the depot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My Second home in London was my friend Chevy's apartment. A new development in
the stylish Central London Suburb of Shoreditch. She doesn't like it, she 
thinks it was cheaply constructed and is annoyed by the design decsicions, or
lack of them, that were made. But she had a spare bed in her lounge room; The 
place had come furnished but she had her own bed she liked so moved the owners
to the large loungeroom. But I think it's great.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm broke and wouldn't get paid for a long time &lt;sup id="fnref:2"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2" rel="footnote"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. My first month was rent 
free. And as it's only a bed in a loungeroom it's cheap even when I do start
paying. Unfortunately I can be quite a bad houseguest. And this situation was
very much still like I was a guest in someone else's house. While rent 
was always paid, it was not always prompt. And with my tendency to treat home as
just somewhere to sleep and the tiring nature of the physical work I wasn't 
the best company even when I was home. I think Chevy was starting to think her 
hospitality was being taken advantage of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However this is the time when my social life exploded in London. I found the improv 
scene. I started making friends. Hoopla, then C3467X and Duck Duck Goose. Shem
and Carleen became my first real London friends that I made all on my own. Then
Carleen put me together with Will, Corey and James and we formed
the soon to be named King Me troupe, although we played our first gig, the 
improv 5-a-side, as "Mumma's Boys" named by the proud Carleen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was living with a good friend. I had a bunch of new improv friends. I was 
seeing Anne fairly regularly as she also worked in the city, and slowly being
introduced to her circle of London friends.
I even started to take advatange of the London bits of London; I saw the Book of
Mormon, Let the Right One in and Warhorse. Theatre is still expensive but some
is better than none. It was a good time. Mostly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Growing frustrations start to bubble to the surface. Work is leading to an
escalating cycle of tiredness and frustration. London is an expensive city to
live in. Despite a full time job and the cheapest possible rent, I feel 
very poor. In two weeks a new contract means we're moving depots and I will
probably be back in a van full time. I'm training new drivers right now anyway 
so most days are in the van already. I didn't quit my job in Australia to 
travel halfway accross the globe to spend my days driving a van again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An escape is needed. Vic and Nevine are in
France. "Come spend a few days in Dieppe with us and some French friends". So
after 5 months in London, my first adventure into Europe is back to France.
A train to Brighton. A ferry to Dieppe. And three days spent on beach made up
of smooth pebbles the size of tennis balls. It is glorious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;London is returned to with much trepidation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;London starts to collapse after this. My trip to Chicago to study improv for 5
weeks is less than 2 months away. My preliminary budget leaves me with exactly
no money on arrival in America.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While in Dieppe, Chevy told me
that she needs me out of the apartment so that Katie can move in in a few weeks.
I knew it was coming, but it was an awkward end, the earlier tensions making it
more stressful than it needed to be. I went straight to a hostel on returning
to London. I had an ambitious plan to work during the week then travel to 
somewhere new in England each weekend. I went to Nottingham and that's it before 
this plan ended.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My third home in London arrived as an offer from a work friend when he heard I 
was living in Hostels full time. It was a room in an apartment in Muswell Hill. 
One of London's "highest"
points (London is rather flat) and a nice suburb. But an hours bus ride from
work and central london. Way outside the Borris Bike zone. I hesitated before
moving in, but it was 30 pounds cheaper a week than a hostel, and my budget
needed the help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Work lasts 3 more weeks before the combination of early starts and little sleep
due to the now much longer commute both ways and the frustration at 
full time van driving in a
small pocket of central london build up to the point of me quitting the job 3 
weeks earlier than planned. So much for the budget.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile
I'm doing improv fairly regularly but I'm not entirely happy with the way I'm
playing. I'm frustrated  with myself, I'm not performing as much as I want and
I'm not travelling Europe. These were the two reasons I moved to the UK. I'm 
starting to get homesick. I miss my friends in Sydney but most of all I'm missing
my sister Lily, who is now seven years old and growing up fast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I borrow a bicycle from a friend of a friend. The three times I ride it are 
wonderful. It really is a great way to get around town. It's stolen, despite 
being locked up, the third time I ride it. I sit where the bike was stolen, 
almost cry and vow that I'm done with this city. It's hard to remember the good
parts at this point; berry picking in two different parts of the English 
countryside, picnics with friends in the green English summer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I catch the plane back to America, filled with excitement of what's to come,
frustration at the city I'm leaving and a significant lack of accomodation
booked for a trip I've been planning for months. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="footnote"&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:1"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ah British Beauracracy, my first real pang of homesickness. I will try 
never to complain about things taking a long time in Australia ever again.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:1" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:2"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everyone in London is paid monthly, something I've not had to deal with
before. Also I'm still having issues with my National Insurance Number, the 
number required for paying tax. After 3 and a half months. See footnote 1.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:2" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

I haven't done much since
I got to London, but I want to start writing about stuff a little closer to now
but still feel an urge to wrap up the previous trip. So I'm going to rip 
through it quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;A Brief overview&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is a list of things that happened post Charlotte in the approximate order
that they occured.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I stopped for lunch in Asheville. And loved the place so much I stayed for
dinner, went to a bar to watch some bluegrass music and met some awesome people.
Overall North Carolina continuously had my best experiences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had to stop at this bowling alley and play a game. I mean look at it.
&lt;a href="https://flic.kr/p/og63XR"&gt;&lt;img alt="P1010336" src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3883/14610581863_45f2901ceb_c.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href="https://flic.kr/p/oeiYHX"&gt;&lt;img alt="P1010337" src="https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2905/14590471065_04a51198a0_c.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href="https://flic.kr/p/nWP4DC"&gt;&lt;img alt="P1010338" src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3866/14403765450_5ee7743ec2_c.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nashville on the other hand didn't have as much appeal. Just had a weird vibe
about the place or something I don't know. I went to check in to hostel in the
center of town when I realised I'd left my driver's license back in Charlotte.
Decided to leave the hostel and keep driving. But I kept going west rather than
doubling back, I'd get my license on the return.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I played poker on a river boat in Metropolis. And I met Superman.
&lt;a href="https://flic.kr/p/nWQp7a" title="He didn't say much"&gt;&lt;img alt="P1010346" src="https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2928/14404026017_07466f6f76_c.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Got to St. Louis and realised I left one of my shirts behind in Metropolis.
Kept looking for outdoor stores where I could by a replacement icebreaker shirt.
Ended up driving straight through St. Louis without stopping. Only thing I can
say about the experience is that months later when House of Cards featured 
it in the background of a scene, I recognised it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Got to Kansas city. More degenarate poker playing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Started driving through Kansas. I'd been warned Kansas was different, it
wouldn't be fun to drive across. I didn't believe it. I've written a more
detailed account of Kansas below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abandoned plan to drive to San Francisco and started heading south again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Played poker at two different Native American Casinos. (I played a lot more 
poker than I realised).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stopped in Dallas for dinner at a restaurant that was recommended to me by
a vegan at the first Casino in the previous point. It was very good. The next
day was the anniversary of the JFK assasination. Something a traveller might
want to stay in town to experience. I drove east instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally got to New Orleans. Visited Bourbon street. Seems like a fun place
if you were drunk but wasn't my cup of tea. Stayed one night in a hostel, but
there was no room the next night, stayed in my car.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a grand total of two days in New Orleans, decided it wasn't for me and
headed north. Amount of live music experienced: minimal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spent my birthday alone driving a car.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Made it back to the jewel of America, North Carolina. In Charlotte I got
my licence back and had a great dinner at a Vegetarian restaurant. The next day
I found myself in a college town called Greensboro further noth. Stopping at 
another vegetarian restaurant (I
mainly navigated around the country using the &lt;a href="www.happycow.net"&gt;Happy Cow&lt;/a&gt;
phone app) I made friends with the wait staff. They were the best. They took me
out to a bar after they finished work. Told me about the Civil Rights museum
in town which I checked out the next day. They were so lovely, I went back and
had lunch there the next day before I had to get back on the road. Have I 
mentioned that North Carolina was my favourite place in America?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2 days later I returned the car in Washington D.C. and caught and bus back
to New York.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because I got back a few days early, I was able to kind of experience
Thanksgiving with Nick before he was leaving the country. 
I say kind of because I don't think there was an actual American amongst us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And on the last evening my friend Chevy was in town from London. She was
staying at Nick's after I left. So we went out, and went ice skating in front
of the Rockefeller building. Then at about 4am I started making my way to 
the airport to catch my plane to London.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Kansas: A study&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Kansas is different, you'll see"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to focus a little on Kansas in more detail because it's kind of a turning
point in the story and an example of where I think I went wrong in some of
my attitude to travel on this trip. A lesson I should re-learn now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were some phrases that were repeated again and again as I would cross
America. When I mentioned that my original plan was to hitch across the country
I would get a lot of "Oh no, you're crazy. You can't do that anymore."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I believe there is a lot revealed in the psyche of, if not Americans in general,
at least the ones I met. What is revealed, I'm not entirely sure. There is 
definitly a lot of fear in the
air. I would often think unfounded fear, and then I'd remember how many guns 
were around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Something else I heard everywhere I went, when I told people where I was going,
"Oh, they're not as nice as us here." This always turned out to be a lie. 
Everyone I met was lovely. I never met these phantom awful people everyone else
was afraid of. Again a statment that reveals something, not so much in what is 
said but in the sheer repetition. Here is good, there not so much. &lt;sup id="fnref:1"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1" rel="footnote"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So seeing the obvious falseness of this commonly held belief, I dismissed the 
warning I kept receiving as I moved further and further west. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Oh yeah, it's nice driving through here, but Kansas is different."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I figured all this exaggeration about the madness inducing flatness of Kansas
was just that, an exaggeration. How wrong I was.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I saw a lot of rest stops on this trip. And each state has a definite fee to
their rest stops. All had the same basic layout accross the 
country but there is a stil a unique feel to each state. But Kansas is the 
scariest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scariest is the wrong feeling. Foreboding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kansas is the most Foreboding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At each rest stop in Kansas is a speaker crackling out the weather report:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fine Weather Today.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Getting Colder as the week continues.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;There may be snow by the end of the week.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Repeat forever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Honestly at this point I feel like I'm living in some post-apocolyptic film or 
video game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I'm a little worried about snow later in the week, I'm not prepared for that
and I know I'm heading up the Colardo mountains. But the weather report says
it will be fine for a few days. So why does this whole situation just give me
the heebee jeebies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe it is the flatness. There is no corn. It's November so all the corn has
been harvested. So literally the only thing I can see is this weird juxtapositon
of fields of small oil pumps alongside fields of windmill genearators. And 
nothing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not nothing. Nothing I can deal with. I've breifly visited the north-west corner
of Australia. Once I was outside of town, you are literally nowhere. There is 
nothing for miles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See Kansas is different. There's not nothing. There's something else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kansas has two main routes. The interstate heading East-West, and the interstate
heading North-South. And they meet roughly in the middle of the state.
I'm driving west. And every 20 or 30 so miles, I would pass a small town, with a
water tower declaring their name. A lot of towns, but still a feeling of nothing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I stopped and bought a pizza from a Pizza Hut in one of these towns. I think 
that illustrates most clearly what I'm trying to say. You're just not really
in the middle of nowhere if you can stop and buy Pizza Hut. But then I
drove to park to have an a pizza picnic. And again despite being in what 
amounted to small town suburbia, there was that overwheling air of isolation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I thought as I ate. 
I was only halfway accross the state. I could abandon this mad dash to get
to the West Coast. Why am I in such a hurry. Sure it would be nice to see Andy,
but I didn't have to see him. I would no doubt be back at another time. I could
do San Francisco properly at another time, without an artificial rush.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the Kansas madness must of been setting in. I was already halfway. I could
make it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Six Hours, 3 more rest stop nightmare factories and one gas station fill up 
later I crossed the Colarado border. The road was immediately different. There
was a physical line at the border where two different strains of ashphalt 
greeted each other&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I pulled into a rest stop and really started to evaluate my situation
again. It was getting late, I'd have to stop for the night soon. People had
warned me there were a few more hours of flat after crossing the border before
the mountains started. More of the same if with a slightly different flavour. 
But then I looked at my map of America again. I had barely reached the halfway 
point of the country. If I was going to cross in 3 days I would have to drive 
without stopping. And then I would have to turn back straight away again to get
back to the East Coast &lt;sup id="fnref:2"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2" rel="footnote"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;I wasn't going to make it to San Francisco. It was 
time to go back to plan A and head for New Orleans. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think the lesson to learn here is that there's no reason to be in a rush to
get nowhere. I'm not saying that seeing San Francisco with Andy wouldn't have
been nice. But if I'd taken that route, that's not the trip I was signing up 
for. I would be signing up for hours and hours of driving with little chance to
stop and smell the metaphorical roses. If you've read the list, you'll see I
didn't really learn this lesson very well. I practically bypassed Dallas in a 
similar non-necessary rush to get to New Orleans. And in my rush to get there
I didn't really give myself the chance to enjoy myself once I got there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In complete opposition to this, when I removed the rush I enjoyed myself more.
Washington DC and all the Nortch Carolina stops, both outbound and return 
journeys, were the highlights of the trips because I was able to take my time
and enjoy myself, staying longer if I wanted. I think it's important still to
have a need to leave eventually. I feel some of my disappointments with New
York initially were that I had little impetus to go out and have daily 
adventures because I had so much time, but at the same time it wasn't "home" so
something still felt off. I think I'm having a similar experience in London.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After all that though, and as fun as it is to evaluate decicions and experiences
in retrospect and add more significance to them than they probably warrent, 
I think the Kansas experience sticks so much in my mind
as a big deal is a geography fact. You'll remember there is essentially only 
two roads through Kansas. And they meet in the middle. The shortest distance
south was back the way I came. So after a grand total of half an hour in 
Colorado I turned around, and headed straight back into Kansas. An empty pizza
box in the passenger seat mocked me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="footnote"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In probably a related phenomenon, everyone was shocked that I'd left 
Australia. It was unfathomable that someone would leave somewhere they had heard
was so nice just because I wanted to see other things.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:1" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:2"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Flying back wasn't a great option. There was the one way cost of the hire
car but then there was also the fact that my driver's license was in Charlotte.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:2" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

It turns out, travelling south
for warmth only works if you don't get caught in a cold snap. It was too
cold to go walking outside so I kept driving south, stopping for dinner
on the road. But here's a photo anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/97350976@N07/10848168265/" title="It's a small town!"&gt;&lt;img alt="P1010295" src="http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2816/10848168265_b17347699b_c.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I pulled into a rest stop about 9:30 to get a few hours rest. I knew it
would be cold, so plan was to rest a few hours, wake up drive some more,
pull over and rest another few hours. First part went well, I slept
until 1230 or 1am. Get back into the drivers seat, turn key and ...
nothing. I'd left my headlights on, and with the cold temps the
batteries had drained. I wasn't going anywhere. The next hour consisted
of me asking every person who stopped to use the bathroom if they had
jumper leads. No one did. I kept trying out the key periodically hoping
to get lucky. And then, all of a sudden, the car turned over and
sputtered to life. And so did the heater. Magic. Waited for the car to
warm up a little. Drove a few more hours before stopping at another rest
stop, making sure the lights were off, and getting a few more hours
sleep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was very close to Charlotte at this point. Shortly after sunrise I was
back on the road. Rounding the bend I unexpectedly came across the city.
It was a magnificent sight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No photo, I was driving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had breakfast a vegan cafe, great start to the day. I'd booked a super
cheap hotel online, but they weren't able to check me in early. I did a
google search of things to do in Charlotte when the phrase disc golf
jumped into my eye.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The park was called Hornets Nest. After failing to find a disc at
Walmart (my first Walmart trip as well today. It's big I guess) I
stopped by to have a look at the course before going to a sports store.
I never made it to the sports store because I was super lucky to meet my
new friend Brian.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/97350976@N07/10848813463/" title="Back at hole 1 after a round."&gt;&lt;img alt="P1010297
cropped" src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3787/10848813463_c89be91e36_c.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He's a huge frisbee golf enthusiast and great guy. He lent me a disc and
we played a round of 18 together. His score of 72 was much more
impressive than my score of 103. It was great to throw a disc around
again. Although it is a bit more difficult throwing an actual disc golf
disc rather than the ultimate frisbee sized disc I'm used to. Hornets
Nest is his favourite course in the area (turns out Charlotte is kind of
the frisbee golf capital of the world, they have heaps of courses) and I
can see why. The surroundings are beautiful, and the back nine is
essentially a walk through the woods; a bit difficult to play through
but very picturesque.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the cafe in the morning, I was told about the Mint Museum, which is
more of an art gallery and free on Tuesday nights. I checked in to my
hotel, had a long overdue nap, a shower and caught the last hour of the
gallery. It was small but had some wonderful pieces. And with a pizza at
a cool restaurant a few blocks away, the perfect way to end a
wonderfully unique day in Charlotte.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tomorrow morning I'm back on the road, this time headed west. I've
decided to head straight for San Francisco and do Austin and New Orleans
on the return so that I can catch up with Andy before he goes on
vacation on the 22nd. Nick is also there this week, so it'll be good to
see them both, and kind of do an early birthday thing with them.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="Adventure"></category><category term="America"></category><category term="Charlotte"></category><category term="Cold"></category><category term="Disc"></category><category term="Disc Golf"></category><category term="Driving"></category><category term="Frisbee"></category><category term="New Friends"></category><category term="Travel"></category><category term="USA"></category></entry><entry><title>Washington DC and the Chesapeake &amp; Ohio Towpath</title><link href="http://www.realityimprovement.com/2013/November/washington-dc-and-the-chesapeake-ohio-towpath/" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2013-11-13T05:20:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Alistair</name></author><id>tag:www.realityimprovement.com,2013-11-13:2013/November/washington-dc-and-the-chesapeake-ohio-towpath/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Monday night I got off the bus, walked into Union Station (awesome) and
then as I exit I'm greeted with this view of the Capitol Building.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/97350976@N07/10821858913/" title="That's the capitol building at the back"&gt;&lt;img alt="P1010086" src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3690/10821858913_39fc2a149f_c.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got a bit closer. This fountain was in front of the building (It's
behind me in this photo)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/97350976@N07/10821857413/" title="ooh, mesmerizing"&gt;&lt;img alt="P1010090" src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5520/10821857413_91e17d3e7c_c.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And it was cold! I got my phone out and started looking for a hostel to
spend the night in. I found the Youth Hostel International and went
there. And I'm super glad I did. There is at least one activity
everyday, usually a walking tour. I spent Tuesday on my own at the
Natural History museum and a little bit of the Air and Space museum.
Unfortunately my tour on Tuesday night was cancelled, but I was still so
tired I didn't mind too much. Wednesday however was excellent.
Originally I'd planned just the day in DC but wanted to do the night
monuments tour so I stayed an extra day. I met some awesome people, did
two tours a morning and then the night monuments, went back to the air
and space museum and took some more photos of the capitol. One of my new
friends, Pat, travels a lot. he commutes across canada for work, week on
week off kind of deal. But the company will let him fly anywhere that
costs the equivalent of flying home, and since it is a cross canadian
flight which is expensive. So he has a routine of finding gigs in the
towns he's visiting. So Wednesday night after walking forever all day, I
went and watch a concert. It was amazing but I was soo tired by the end
of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/97350976@N07/10821563906/" title="YEAH!"&gt;&lt;img alt="P1010178" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7375/10821563906_235021f90f_c.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I'd been on the Post Office tour in the morning, I'd spoken to the
ranger about nearby hikes, see if there was anything I could do in short
time. She told me about the Chesapeake &amp;amp; Ohio towpath that goes for 180
miles and meets up for part of the Appalachian Trail, which seemed cool.
I did a quick google and decided to try a 60 mile section to a place
called Harper's Ferry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've been doing a lot of research into lightweight backpacking and
hammocks and stuff so I decided to buy a hammock for the trip. I knew
the downside of a hammock is that it can get cold underneath using just
a sleeping bag and decided to get a wool blanket instead, it's a bit
heavier but I wouldn't have to worry about a sleeping pad, and if it
turns out I was wrong about my layering system for my clothes I could
wear it as a cloak during the day for extra warmth. So leaving late in
the day thursday (it took a while to go shopping and get to the trail,
plus I slept in the morning) I set off. Sorry no photos of my campsites,
first night I didn't make a campsite so was camping on the side of the
trail, which isn't really allowed. Second night I got to camp after
dark, and in the morning was so cold I had to break camp and start
walking as soon as it was light so I could get the blood flowing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;THINGS LEARNED ON THE TRAIL:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;1. I don't travel as light as I think I do:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I definitely travel lighter than most. I know I still have a little bit
of extra weight compared to ultralight travelers, but I didn't think it
would be too bad to hike with everything I was carrying. It might not
have been if I'd been using an actual hiking pack, but because I was
using my Aeronaut bag, which has backpack straps, but isn't really
designed for long term carrying. But to add a blanket, food, hammock and
water to a pack that is already not as light as it could be, and isn't
designed for hiking was a mistake. The reason ultralight hikers get away
without suspension is they are not carrying stuff like a laptop with
them, even if it is my lightweight surface pro.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;2. Do more research:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I made two research mistakes. I bought the Hennessy Hammock backpacker
ultralight kit. I hadn't done enough research to know that it is
designed for people under 6 foot, and I'm slightly over. I knew the
theory behind getting comfortable in a hammock but couldn't achieve it
because it was the wrong size for me. But the bigger mistake was not
looking at what the temperatures were going to be. I thought I'd made a
mistake getting a blanket rather than sleeping bag and pad because I was
so cold at night. It was only when I went online and looked at the
temperatures that the second night had got down to freezing temperature.
So I guess the system worked, since the only really bad thing was my
feet, which froze almost immediately without a second pair of thick
socks. But I was very very cold. I don't think there will be another
camping trip this autumn unless it's much, much warmer down south.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;3. The towpath is okay to walk, but would be much better to ride:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The towpath was very pretty, but not that interesting of a hike.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/97350976@N07/10821825693/" title="Look Pretty!"&gt;&lt;img alt="P1010259" src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3743/10821825693_36d1ddcf06_c.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The towpath is completely flat over its lenghth. Well that's not true,
it's actually a very, very gentle rise, but it feels flat walking it.
It's also covered in gravel. If I was strolling along, it's probably a
very enjoyable experience, but feeling weighed down, and rushing to get
to the next campsite before dark, the flat terrain can wear you down. If
I was to do it again, I'd probably try cycling or unicycling instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;4. Know my limits:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was aiming for Harper's Ferry which is 60ish miles along the track. I
thought I could make it in 2-3 days. And if I didn't have to carry my
bag and it was summer, so I had an hour or two extra daylight and wasn't
so cold at night, I probably could. I did make it to White's Ferry,
which is 35.5 miles from the start, at about 1pm on Saturday. Since I
only hike about 5 or more miles on the Thursday because I started so
late, that might've been possible, I would estimate that was
approximately a 20 mile a day pace. But I was dead after that. I
couldn't go on. I abandoned my plan for Harper's Ferry, and started
making my way into town, to Leesburg, about 5 miles away. White's ferry
is a cool old ferry across the river, which I caught. No photos, I'd put
the camera away the day before and hadn't got it out again, too tired.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;5. I'm really bad with names. (Also Americans are really religous)&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had two really cool experiences with people, but I can't remember
their names, which annoys me a lot. The first was with a cyclist that
past me twice during the day. He was doing a 60 mile ride, starting at
about mile 22 on the track, down to D.C for lunch and back again. He
spoke about how he knew Jesus, asked if I knew him. I tactfully said not
personally. But he was a super nice guy, who told me he'd had a
premonition about sharing lunch with someone. That hadn't happened but
then he'd seen me twice during the day hiking and he decided I was the
guy from the premonition and he gave me 10 bucks and a musli bar. I was
super tired and worried about getting to camp before dark (I didn't it
was dark by the time I got there), so even though he got a photo of me,
I don't have a photo of him and I forgot his name. Blargh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was about halfway to town when I came across someone changing a tyre.
I asked if I could get a lift when he was done, he said yes, but didn't
seem happy about it. Shortly later another guy pulled up asking if he
could help. The tyre guy was fine, and I asked if I could get a lift to
town, and he said yes. The motel was actually just around the corner
from his house. So this was my first (and possibly only in America)
hitchhike. I can not remember his name though. I do remember he was on
his way home from doing some work at his pastors house.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What next?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I spent two days at the Days Inn Leesburg. After the first night, I woke
up, still too sore to do anything useful and booked a second day. And it
was expensive. Each night cost \$100. If I do that every night I would
spend a lot of money. And I realised if I decided to hitchhike, I'd have
no control over where I end up each day, and would have to use these
side of the road motels which could be quite expensive. I'd already
looked into hiring a car and knew it worked out to be cheaper if I was
okay sleeping in it, even with petrol costs. So this is what I've done.
I've hired a small Toyota Yaris.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And between the big stops where I can stay at a hostel or couch surf,
I'll sleep in the car at the side of the road.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="Adventure"></category><category term="America"></category><category term="Camping"></category><category term="Driving"></category><category term="Hiking"></category><category term="New Friends"></category><category term="Photos"></category><category term="Travel"></category><category term="USA"></category><category term="Washington D.C."></category></entry><entry><title>Trying to travel better</title><link href="http://www.realityimprovement.com/2013/November/trying-to-travel-better/" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2013-11-06T03:02:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Alistair</name></author><id>tag:www.realityimprovement.com,2013-11-06:2013/November/trying-to-travel-better/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;First of all, I haven't posted about New York. It was great, I saw some
improv, some comedy, I saw a Broadway show and I went to Sleep No More
which was fantastic and I want to go back. Although I might read Macbeth
before that though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And New York had the best day ever, which is a Halloween puppy parade.
In costume!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Look it's hulk dog!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/97350976@N07/10530531976/" title="HULK DOG!"&gt;&lt;img alt="P1000918" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7291/10530531976_a72172a599_c.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And these guys won best costume, lobster and chef dogs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/97350976@N07/10530528655/" title="They were very cute. See previous image in flikr set for a better overview of whole set up"&gt;&lt;img alt="P1000906" src="http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2873/10530528655_6b6f619591_c.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, as good as New York was, and as wonderful as the people I met were,
there was still that same feeling that I had in Paris. That I wasn't
entirely satisfied with my trip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't want to say that it was too easy because I don't believe that my
travels should be difficult. Rather that I haven't challenged myself to
grow or change. Before continuing I have to say that I'm super grateful
to my friends who have let me stay at their place. Staying with friends
has been wonderful (and cheap). But the longish stays with no plans (or
job) and the fact that they go out during the days means there were
quite a few days I would stay home rather than go out exploring. The
worst were the days I would sleep in, then spend the rest of the day on
the internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a problem for me, because I tend towards laziness, which leads
to a downward spiral of bad days. Cindy very insightfully said to me on
a morning in Lyon when I was delaying getting off the couch and outside,
"Being in a different country isn't going to cure depression.” It is
inevitable that I'm going to have down days still. And I'll have the
occasional manic day too. But if I'm being someone I don't like on
normal days, how am I supposed to get through the bad ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, there are some things I need to work out. Short term and long term.
In the short term I wanted to get out of bed and get moving everyday, to
have new experiences. So I stayed in New York for Halloween, but now I
have left.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/97350976@N07/10692039953/" title="Insert where did I go, there I am joke here"&gt;&lt;img alt="P1010067" src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5492/10692039953_5c4413d283_c.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No safety net. I'm on my own and via hitch-hiking and other cheap
transport I'm going to attempt to cross the country, or as much as I can
do before I leave. So far I've caught a bus to Atlantic City, where I
spent a few days. I caught another bus to Washington D.C. where I'm
sitting now in a hostel writing this post. The rough plan from here is
to head south, aiming for New Orleans. Then West across Texas and the
southern States, a stop in Las Vegas and L.A. and hopefully all the way
to San Francisco to meet up with my friend Andy. If for some reason
everything goes much quicker than planned and I don't then fly back to
New York, I'll come back via Chicago to watch some more improv.
Hopefully this plan also helps me with another problem I feel I have
which is a fair bit of social awkwardness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some other things I've started to implement include timeboxing some
things, to limit my internet usage and to instigate constructive things
like blog writing. Also, I've been dabbling with meditation and being
present and focused.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the long term I need to find what I want to do next. The plan at the
moment is to alternate work in the UK with travel in Europe. And this
may be fine, I don't know yet, I haven't tried. But I feel a better
solution is going to be a digital job that I can do on the road so that
I can live more of a digital nomad life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With this in mind I have a few things I would like to get better at: my
art and to get back into making comics; more performing, predominately
acting and improv, but also get back into stand up; writing; possibly
editing; and music. This last one is giving me a bit of a problem at the
moment. I'm still carrying around the mandolin I was given by a friend
in Sydney. But I really don't play it enough to justify carrying it
around. The mandolin itself isn't that heavy, but I've put it in a case
and it is big enough and awkward enough to get in the way. I'm otherwise
carrying around just one bag, and that bag is almost light enough that I
could carry it around all day without worry (There is a whole post to
come on bags and what I'm carrying with me). The mandolin means I always
need to find somewhere to dump my luggage for the day. So I either need
to make this a part of my daily routine or it's time to let the bulky
instrument go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A final related skill I want to start learning is animation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway I'm going to post this and go out and explore Washington. I
didn't really take any photos of Atlantic City, it's a weird place and I
spent a lot of it at the poker table anyway. But I did make sure I
walked the boardwalk. It was cold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I'll finish this post with two photos of central park. This one was
my favourite.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/97350976@N07/10530462003/" title="Something something, photography, something something, capturing light"&gt;&lt;img alt="P1000852" src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5529/10530462003_c5059d9317_c.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And this was great. I had walked halfway around the lake before seeing
this sign.&lt;/p&gt;

Through a quirk of geography and
weird bus routes, in high school it was almost exactly the same amount
of time to walk to school through the bush as to catch the afternoon bus
home. So I would often walk home that way, dressed in my school shoes
and uniform, carrying my bag full of books. I have just realised how
much I must have enjoyed this because typing that out makes it seem like
a lot of hard work. But growing up in Australia I learnt to enjoy the
outdoors but was also warned of the many things that can hurt you like
spiders and snakes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had been reading about so many barefooted adventures though that when
I arrived in Fontainbleau by train and started walking through the bush
I felt an urge to remove my shoes and try my first ever barefoot hike.
And it was great. I thoroughly enjoyed myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/97350976@N07/10280265956/" title="My feet ready for adventure"&gt;&lt;img alt="P1000622" src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5468/10280265956_ba52674788_c.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The day started late as I slept in longer than planned. This worked out
well as Nick's connecting flight from Barcelona to Paris had been
delayed and we had lunch at a nice vegetarian restaurant near Notre
Dame. I then hopped on a train south while he caught a taxi back to the
airport.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had headed to Fontainbleau and the suggestion of my hosts. There is
apparently a nice chateau with awesome gardens there, but I never made
it because as soon a got off the train I headed straight into the woods.
I walked for ages, saw some cool looking trees, rocks, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/97350976@N07/10280389953/" title="Scary/cool mine cave thing"&gt;&lt;img alt="P1000623" src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3833/10280389953_d66fc4079a_c.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Took some photos of bugs&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/97350976@N07/10530606003/" title="Hello!"&gt;&lt;img alt="P1000632" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7337/10530606003_e0893dd887_c.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cool moment about an hour before getting dark was coming across this
stone look out tower that had a 360 degree view of everything around it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/97350976@N07/10530414634/" title="Imposing and practical"&gt;&lt;img alt="P1000641" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7370/10530414634_c77ce7c76c_c.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I walked around a little too long, it was dark by the time I got back to
the village. But I grabbed a cheap but delicious pizza for dinner and
waited for the train back to Paris. The pizza was a little difficult to
eat because it's not customary in France to cut it into slices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've called it my favourite day in Paris because it reminded me (as well
as walking around the gardens of Versailles to a lesser extent) how
important walking the great outdoors is to me. It is definitely going to
impact my plans next year, if not also how I'm going to spend my time
after New York. Stay tuned for that as it's hopefully going to be
exciting. But also I tried something new with the barefoot hike, and it
was very successful. My feet didn't hurt at the end but they were
covered in dirt, which is fine by me. But it also brushed off quickly
and cleanly as well, which was also nice.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="Adventure"></category><category term="Barefoot"></category><category term="Bush Walking"></category><category term="Fontainbleau"></category><category term="France"></category><category term="Hiking"></category><category term="Insect"></category><category term="Nature"></category><category term="Paris"></category><category term="Priorities"></category><category term="Travel"></category></entry><entry><title>Quick wrap up of Paris</title><link href="http://www.realityimprovement.com/2013/October/quick-wrap-up-of-paris/" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2013-10-30T09:37:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Alistair</name></author><id>tag:www.realityimprovement.com,2013-10-30:2013/October/quick-wrap-up-of-paris/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I've been in New York now for 2 and a half weeks so I've decided to
condense Paris into two posts. This one will be a quick wrap up and
tomorrow I'll post a day report of one of my favourite days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Summing up my experience in Paris is weird. Thinking back it feels like
I didn't do all that much but if I look at the photos or think of
specific days (the ones where I didn't stay inside that is) I realise I
did do a lot. I did some of the obviously touristy things; Notre Dame,
Sacre Coeur, The Lourve, Musee D'orsay etc. There were a lot of days
just walking around and seeing what I could see. I discovered an awesome
little botanical gardens which is where those photos of the cats and
peacocks in the previous post came from.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I stayed with a good friend of mine from Australia, Caitlin, who is
doing a PHD in Paris. She has two housemates Carmen and Umeshree and all
three are the best. This photo was from the first night in Paris&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/97350976@N07/10003441786/" title="Caitlin, Carmen and Umeshree"&gt;&lt;img alt="_1000225" src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3667/10003441786_f076b9615c_c.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also hung out a lot with my old housemate from Australia, Nick (this
is also who I'm staying with in New York). Before he went to Barcelona
with other friend Lisa and Sammy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/97350976@N07/10038675513/" title="He wasn't expecting to be photograhed"&gt;&lt;img alt="P1000477" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7302/10038675513_1d35680716_c.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lot of my days consisted of buying a baguette at a boulangerie and
walking till I was lost. Or riding one of the Velibes. The Velibe and
Velo-v system in Lyon were both great, I used them extensively. Arriving
in New York, I have missed how good these systems were. New York has
there Citi Bike system which is similar in principle but priced much
more expensively for tourists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One hightlight was La Nuit Blanche; which is a night festival, where I
walked around and saw art, watched films in the Hotel de Ville and saw
fireworks on the Seine. I got these awesome photos at the beginning of
the evening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This dog was just walking around on his own through the crowd he looked
like he was having so much fun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/97350976@N07/10280288496/" title="P1000599 by Alistair Magee, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="P1000599" src="http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2830/10280288496_a017741626_c.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was a random shot from the hip. I don't know these people are but
love how great this photo turned out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/97350976@N07/10280416483/" title="We're always this cool"&gt;&lt;img alt="P1000592" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7350/10280416483_e032261d33_c.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This building looked great all greened up for the night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/97350976@N07/10280411853/" title="P1000608 by Alistair Magee, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="P1000608" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7408/10280411853_034dcef54c_c.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall Paris, and France was enjoyable will definitely go back. I wish
I was better at french so I could've interacted with the locals more. A
common part of my travels so far, which has continued in New York, is
hanging out with a lot of Australians.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second last day I had in Paris had a fun little coincidence. I'd put
off climbing the Eiffel tower and had finally got round to it. At the
bottom of the stairs though, I ran into Sammy and Lisa again, along with
a friend of Lisa. Lisa is on exchange at a business school near
Versailles, and Sammy was staying with her for the rest of her stay
(she'd been in Paris before their weekdend in Barcelona) so it was a
nice little surprise to run into them and have some company for the
climb.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/97350976@N07/10280355693/" title="P1000658 by Alistair Magee, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="P1000658" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7410/10280355693_e89d7ac25e_c.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I suppose I'll have to learn to start posting photos of myself. So
here's me at the top of the Eiffel Tower. It was very cloudy and windy
and little bit rainy that day. Which was great because there was no
crowd, and the clouds cleared when we got to the top for a great view.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I landed safely in France, hopped a very fast train to Avignon, and was
picked up in a car by a lovely lady named Diana and driven 2 hours to a
place called Le Mazel. Which is both the name of a small hamlet and the
name of the house (that we called the chateau even though that's not
technically accurate) that I was staying in. An improv buddy of mine,
Cindy, was celebrating her birthday in style with a long holiday in
France with friends from Australia and the rest of the world. When I
told her of my travel plans she insisted I join her for some of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was our view from the top of the tower on the chateau. There was a
forest fire two valleys over on the second day that I was there. Five
aeroplanes water-bombed it all afternoon and it was out by nightfall.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/97350976@N07/10004216725/" title="obviously this wasn't the only view, it was a tower, there was lots to see"&gt;&lt;img alt="20130919_163751" src="http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2861/10004216725_4d4aee094b_z.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's a different view.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/97350976@N07/10004215694/" title="Somedays, there was no fire at all"&gt;&lt;img alt="20130917_172046" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7292/10004215694_3b9d2d2b76_z.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mostly I laid around and rested. Went for a few walks, saw some old coal
mining sites and a roman viaduct that spanned the bottom of a valley.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/97350976@N07/10004225975/" title="Look, roman thing. That means it's really old"&gt;&lt;img alt="20130918_125211" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7359/10004225975_ebb7e67d4d_z.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was a grasshopper that turned up at dinner one night. He ate some
of my balsamic vinegar, and enjoyed it so much he hung around until
dinner the next night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/97350976@N07/10004335523/" title="He was very friendly"&gt;&lt;img alt="20130918_203233" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7298/10004335523_3358178fe4.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the other guests found this awesome pink an white rose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/97350976@N07/10004214805/" title="2 coloured rose. Must be a mutant. I hope it's one of those nice X-men mutants."&gt;&lt;img alt="20130920_102809" src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3817/10004214805_dd5865ce6a_z.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a few days the Chateau portion of the trip was over. I kept
travelling Cindy and Diana to Lyon, while everyone else went their own
way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the first things I did was use the awesome VeloV system, which is
hired bicycles (A system that actually works because there are no helmet
laws or a helmet law exemption or something). I used the bikes almost
everyday. One of the more fun things was riding along the river and
discovering a huge park that had a botanical gardens in it...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/97350976@N07/10004182864/" title="I don't know why I liked this bulbous thing so much"&gt;&lt;img alt="20130922_164540" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7357/10004182864_230ecb2dae.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/97350976@N07/10004191475/"&gt;&lt;img alt="20130922_165657" src="http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2867/10004191475_756b46e0d4.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And a small zoo!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/97350976@N07/10004178234/" title="surprise zoo"&gt;&lt;img alt="20130922_170339" src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5323/10004178234_fa4afbc7e6.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This guy was one of two spectacled bears in the zoo. I stumpbled across
the zoo by accident and these guys were the first thing I saw. It was
unexpected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did a whole bunch more stuff in Lyon. But I didn't take many photos,
because I didn't have a camera and while the camera in my phone is okay
for a phone camera, it isn't the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So on the last day in Lyon I bought a new camera!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/97350976@N07/10004240815/" title="The very first photo taken. Of course it's a selfie."&gt;&lt;img alt="P1000001" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7386/10004240815_151ca627e6_z.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's the panasonic GX7 and a 20mm prime lens for it. I've wanted it for
about 2 months, when I first read about it, but it's brand new and only
became available this week. All the reviews indicated that it met my
needs of small camera (in comparison to a dslr, its still larger than a
point and shoot) and good photo quality, as well as decent video
capabilities. And I have to say it's really lived up to expectations,
and taken some great photos over the last few days, some of which I'll
post to here in the next few days. I'm not going to post everything on
the blog, but a lot is available at my flikr for those who are curious.
I'll eventually get a zoom lens but I'm limited to the prime for now,
which will be a fun challenge hopefully.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's one of Cindy (normally a huge grin on her face, i caught her at a
ponderous moment)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/97350976@N07/10004092636/" title="P1000030 by Alistair Magee, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="P1000030" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7337/10004092636_6cb243bf29_c.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm very excited by the camera and plan to post to this blog a photo I
think is particularly interesting, quirky or fun everyday. So here is
your first interesting photo, some small books Cindy made in Lyon using
pamphlets and paper she had gathered in her tourist adventures. Stay
tuned for Paris, which is where I am now!&lt;/p&gt;
